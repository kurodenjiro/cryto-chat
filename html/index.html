    <h3 id="chat">Things to know before creating a group chat</h3>
    <p>Choose a complex secret password, then share it with the persons who you would like to chat with - preferably via phone, but for paranoid security level you should meet them face-to-face and remove batteries from all cell phones during the conversation.</p>
    <p>The group's name and password have to be the same for all participants, username can be anything. Group name and username doesn't have to be handled as a secret information, unlike the password.</p>

    <h3 id="works">Let's take a look at the inner workings</h3>
    <p>CHATCRYPT's unique tri-layer encryption starts with a traditional secured <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">WebSocket</a> (wss) connection to the application server, then it builds up a custom <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">Transport Layer Security</a> within it, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">ECDH</a> (with <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ac3c/28ebf9a40319202b3c4f64cc81cdaf193da5.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">NIST P-521</a> curve) for key exchange and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">AES-256</a> (in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Counter_.28CTR.29" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">CTR</a> mode) for ciphering. On this second layer the messages sent from the server are signed with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">ECDSA</a> (using <a href="https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">ED25519</a> curve) and verified with a public key at the client. This layer is responsible for that even transparent proxies with own CA certificates installed on the client cannot inspect or modify the communication (surely only if they didn't modify the chat client's source code - development of a browser extension and a smartphone app is planned).</p>
    <p>The third layer inside the second one is responsible for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">End-to-end encryption</a> between the clients. They build up individual TLS connections with each other within a group, once again using ECDH (but now with <a href="https://cr.yp.to/ecdh.html" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">Curve25519</a> curve) for key exchange and AES-256 (in CTR mode) for ciphering. Most importantly their ECDH shared keys are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">XOR</a>ed with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">SHA-256</a> hashed group password, which results in that their communication cannot be deciphered via participants using another password - if multiple groups being created under the same name but with different passwords, then each group member will be visible only to the ones that entered with the common one.</p>
    <p>Thanks to the third layer's encryption and to the group password that never leaves the client, it is not possible to decode the messages even on server side. It acts as a dummy router between the group members and does not store any data it passes. The server's source code is available upon a well-founded request.</p>
